			The Hoh Rainforst Flying Stringray is probably the scariest animal on Earth. It is a highly dangerous creature. Imagine what it would be like to be stung in the water by one of these!? Now Imagine you're walking through a rainforest just minding your own business thinking, "I'm sure glad I'm not in the Ocean right now. I am super afraid of being stung by fish in the water. I couldn't be happier now that I'm on land because I know that can't happen!" When all of a sudden, SNAP!!! A freaking Stringray just flew down from the tree above you and stung you like a needle in the haystack you were not actually planning to find.
