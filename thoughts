CA simple Python CAsey

uses curses, has a default folder in linux and an etc file where base config is pulled from.

etc has things like
where to seek CAs  /share/casey/<caname>/ca/.
                                            .openssl.conf
                                            .index.txt
                                            .serial (has 1000 at top of file)
                                            .crlnumber
                                            ./certs
                                            ./crl
                                            ./newcerts
                                            ./private   (mode 700)
                                                    ./.rand
directives for
  ciphers default== sha256


directives are dumped into a dictionary


first module is for preparing the configuration file and the file structure

second module is a collection of functions that execute the commands.

third module is the curses front end

def genKey(**kwargs):
    cipher = aes256
    name =  ca
    numbits = 4096

    execute the command
    openssl genrsa -aes256 -out private/ca.key.pem

    somehow let the input pass through

    changemode on file "private/ca.key.pem" to 400
