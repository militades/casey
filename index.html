       </li>
            <li>
        <p>There are a group of different things which the flyiny tree stingray
        chooses to eat, but by far its favorite food would
        have to be the "Pacific Northwest Tree Octopus"</p></li>
        <br>
        <p>The second favorite choice of food would be "Rainier" Beer Cans, as long as the
        pull tab has not been removed. "there is something about missing pull
        tabs with allows for gastrol intestinal bubbles" </p>
            <li>
          <h3>Shelter</h3>
        </li>
          <li>They have no natural shelter and have been commonly known to use the
          undersides of different natural items such as tree limbs, decks,
           and have even been found on the undersides of planes.</li>
        <li>
          <h3>Breeding</h3>

          <li>
          They have funky wild tree intercourse!

            <p>The only true natural danger to the Fling Tree Stingray
            is the tree nimp. The tree nimp is only a tenth of the size of the
            flying tree stingray, but has a song which when sung within five
            linear foot of the female flying tree stingray's tail, she looses
            one of her two stingers.

             <br>
            The loss of her second stinger makes her unnoticable from then on to
            the male flying tree stingray. Granted there are no actual biological
            changes, yet they will never mate again. The only tangable reasoning
            would be that the female has become so ugle that the male now considers
            them as they would another male!  </p>
